It supports many LED devices and video grabbers.</p><p>In simple words, this software dynamically processes input video signal (using for example current video framebuffer), and converts it into signal to steer ambient light (using for example LED strips controlled over USB device).</p><h2 id="🔥-features" tabindex="-1">🔥 Features <a class="header-anchor" href="#🔥-features" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;🔥 Features&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li>Low CPU usage, ideal for SoCs such as Raspberry Pi</li><li>JSON interface (API) for easy integration into scripts or other applications</li><li>Command line utility for testing and integration into an automated environment</li><li>Priority channels are not tied to a specific LED data provider, i.e. a provider can add and remove LED data without having to maintain a connection to Hyperion.</li><li>Black border detection</li><li>An effects engine with many built-in effects, including the ability to create custom effects via Python scripting</li><li>A multi-lingual web interface for configuration and remote control of Hyperion</li></ul><h2 id="💬-languages" tabindex="-1">💬 Languages <a class="header-anchor" href="#💬-languages" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;💬 Languages&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li><strong>Available in more than 25 different languages</strong> like English, German, French, Polish, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, Portuguese, Hungarian, Dutch and Spanish</li><li><a href="https://poeditor.com/join/project/Y4F6vHRFjA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Your help</a> is very much appreciated to improve these translations or to translate Hyperion in more languages</li></ul><h2 id="🧑‍💻-contributors" tabindex="-1">🧑‍💻 Contributors <a class="header-anchor" href="#🧑‍💻-contributors" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;🧑‍💻 Contributors&quot;">​</a></h2>',10)),u(o),e[1]||(e[1]=t("p",null,"This project exists thanks to all the people who contribute.",-1)),e[2]||(e[2]=t("h2",{id:"📝-license",tabindex:"-1"},[r("📝 License "),t("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#📝-license","aria-label":'Permalink to "📝 License"'},"​")],-1)),e[3]||(e[3]=t("p",null,[r("The source is released under the MIT-License (see "),t("a",{href:"https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT",target:"_blank",rel:"noreferrer"},"https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT"),r(").")],-1))])}const v=n(c,[["render",d]]);export{y as __pageData,v as default};
