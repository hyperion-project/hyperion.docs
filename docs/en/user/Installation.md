Alternatively, Hyperion can be installed on an existing [Raspberry Pi OS (formerly Raspbian)/Debian/Ubuntu](#rpi-debian-ubuntu) system. \
Raspberry Pi users with LibreElec look [here](https://hyperion-project.org/forum/index.php?thread/10463-install-hyperion-ng-on-libreelec-x86-64-rpi-inoffiziell-unofficially/&pageNo=1).

### RPi/Debian/Ubuntu
You can install Hyperion from the commandline using the following 3 steps:

1. First we import the public key from Hyperion:
```shell
wget -qO- https://apt.hyperion-project.org/hyperion.pub.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/hyperion.pub.gpg
```

2. After that we enter Hyperion-Project as source of Hyperion:
```shell
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hyperion.pub.gpg] https://apt.hyperion-project.org/ $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hyperion.list
```

3. Last, we update the package list and install Hyperion:
```shell
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install hyperion
```
