::: tip Use HyperBian's default user and password, if asked for
 - User: `hyperion`
 - Password: `ambientlight`
 
You can choose a different username, but then take care to update Hyperion's preconfigured service later.
To update the service to the [current service user](http://localhost:8080/en/user/Installation.html#change-the-service-user-to-the-current-user)
:::

  * In case your Raspberry Pi has WiFi or you want to use a WiFi stick, you could pre-configure the Wifi SSID and password before you plugin the SD in your Pi. See [HyperBian Wifi](#hyperbian-wifi)
  * Optional: Enable SSH [HyperBian SSH](#HyperBian-SSH)

### HyperBian WiFi
In case you want to use WiFi with your Raspberry Pi, you can include the Wifi SSID and password after you burned the HyperBian-XXXX.img to your SD card for auto configuration on first boot.
Open the SD card with a file explorer. It's called "boot".
 - Create a new  text file
<ImageWrap src="/images/en/user_hyperbian_wpa_suppli1.jpg" alt="Create a new textfile" />
 - Rename it to "wpa_supplicant.conf"
<ImageWrap src="/images/en/user_hyperbian_wpa_suppli2.jpg" alt="Rename to wpa_supplicant.conf"/>
 - Add your WiFi credentials. \
 Replace **YOUR_SSID** and **YOUR_PASSWORD** with your values.
```
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
country=GB

  network={
    ssid="YOUR_SSID"
    psk="YOUR_PASSWORD"
    key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
  }
```
::: warning Note:
You need to replace 'GB' with the ISO code of your country.
See Wikipedia for a list of country codes.
:::
 - Save it! You are done, the WiFi will be configured during next boot

### HyperBian SSH
You should never need it for daily usage, but for completion: To enable SSH access, plugin your sd card with HyperBian already installed into your computer, and open the "boot" partition with a file explorer. Create a empty file named `ssh` in the root directory (without file extension). SSH will be enabled now on next boot.

#### SSH LOGIN
 - User: `hyperion`
 - Password: `ambientlight`
 
 ::: tip
HyperBian is shipped with an English keyboard configured. If you do not own an English keyboard some keys might be found at a different place.
For the first time login, type as you would have an English keyboard; after logging in successfully you can update to your keyboard layout via `sudo raspi-config`.
