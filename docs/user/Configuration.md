# Configuration
Hyperion is fully accessible & configurable via web browser. The interface is fully responsive and created with touch devices in mind.

## Web Interface
Open the web interface by typing the IP address of your device and the port 8090 in your browser. The installation script will show you the address, if you don't know it. \
**Example:** `http://192.168.0.20:8090`

::: tip Hashtag navigation
The web configuration supports hashtags for sitenames, so you could directly open a specific page by calling the hashtag.
**Example:** `http://192.168.0.20:8090/#remote` - will open the remote control page.

### Configuration
We added additional information(s) to each option. Some topics require additional attention which are covered here. If you need more help or lack information, just dive into our [Forum](https://hyperion-project.org/forum/).

#### Language
By default, the web configuration selects the language based on your browser locale or best matching next to. So no configuration is required. In case you want to start learning Hyperion in another language, select from the provided once.

#### Settings level
Settings level prevents a option flooding for new users. While the **Default** level is for beginners and has the lowest amount of options the **Advanced** is for people that want to or need to dive a little deeper. **Expert** is for experts, you shouldn't need it that often.
