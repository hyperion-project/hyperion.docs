# SK6812

The SK6812 powered strip is a 3 pin RGB or RGBW LED Strip that uses only one wire to control the LEDs. For the control of the SK6812 powered LED strip,
timing plays an important role in the one wire control in receiving the data sent into the IC (integrated circuit).
Restricted to a refresh rate of 400Hz and a data rate of 800Hz, this LED strip is not as fast compared to the APA102 LED strip.
The SK6812 is very similar to the [WS2812B](/user/leddevices/spi_pwm/ws2812b.md), and can be used as a drop-in replacement in most applications because it features the same interface and color order.
Itâ€™s PWM frequency is twice that of the [WS2812B](/user/leddevices/spi_pwm/ws2812b.md) which should result in less flickering.
