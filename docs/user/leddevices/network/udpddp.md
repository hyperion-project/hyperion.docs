# UDP DDP

The device streams RGB values using the Distributed Display Protocol ([DDP](https://www.3waylabs.com/ddp/#Data%20Types)) on top of the UDP network protocol.

**The device is not able to detect, if the remote device is not available or failed.**

::: warning Note:
The Distributed Display Protocol issues a subsequent UDP-package per 480 LEDs.
