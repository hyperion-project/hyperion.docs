# UDP Raw

The device streams a set of RGB values using the UDP network protocol.

**The device is not able to detect, if the remote device is not available or failed.**

::: warning Note:
The maximum number of LEDs supported is 490. The current UDP-raw protocol cannot handle the loss of fragmented packets.
Therefore the number of LEDs is limited to have only one package per update.
