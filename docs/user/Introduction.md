# Introduction

[Hyperion](https://github.com/hyperion-project/hyperion.ng) is an **open source** (MIT) Bias or Ambient Lighting implementation for **GNU/Linux**, **macOS** and **Windows**, which you might know from TV manufacturers.
It supports many LED devices and video grabbers.

In simple words, this software dynamically processes input video signal (using for example current video framebuffer), and converts it into signal to steer ambient light (using for example LED strips controlled over USB device).

## Features
- Low CPU usage, ideal for SoCs such as Raspberry Pi
- JSON interface (API) for easy integration into scripts or other applications
- Command line utility for testing and integration into an automated environment
- Priority channels are not tied to a specific LED data provider, i.e. a provider can add and remove LED data without having to maintain a connection to Hyperion.
- Black border detection
- An effects engine with many built-in effects, including the ability to create custom effects via Python scripting
- A multi-lingual web interface for configuration and remote control of Hyperion

## Languages
- **Available in more than 25 different languages** like English, German, French, Polish, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, Portuguese, Hungarian, Dutch and Spanish
