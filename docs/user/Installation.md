## Uninstall Hyperion

### Ubuntu, Debian and friends, LibreELEC, Fedora, macOS, Windows
Hyperion's project [package repository page](https://releases.hyperion-project.org/) provides you with the respective removal instructions

## Hyperion User Data
Hyperion stores user configuration data and customised effects inside the executing user's home directory (folder `.hyperion`).

Alternatively, you can check the "About Hyperion" page.
The `Config path:` entry specifies the location where user data is stored currently.

## Hyperion Linux Service

On non-interactive (headless) environments, a Hyperion service is installed running under the current user.
In same cases, e.g. using ws281x LEDs, Hyperion must run under `root`.
Hyperion provides a command-line utility which allows switching the user running the service.

### Change the service user to 'root'

``` sh:no-line-numbers
sudo updateHyperionUser -u root
```

### Change the service user to the current user
``` sh:no-line-numbers
sudo updateHyperionUser
```
