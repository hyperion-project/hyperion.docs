## LED Layout
Hyperion assigns each single LED a specific position at the picture. These positions are squares and to create a square you need 4 values (top edge, bottom edge, left edge, right edge). These edges are reflected in `hmin`, `hmax` for horizontal and `vmin`, `vmax` for vertical. They have a value range from `0.0` to `1.0`.

Assignment of LED edges

So let's have a closer look. Following a single led definition:
``` json
{
  "hmax": 0.2,
  "hmin": 0,
  "vmax": 0.2,
  "vmin": 0
}
```
Let's visualize the example above!

A single LED definition

So let us add 2 more LEDs to make it more clear \
**The order is important! The first entry is the first LED, the second the second LED, ...**
``` json
{
  "hmax": 0.2,
  "hmin": 0,
  "vmax": 0.2,
  "vmin": 0
},
{
  "hmax": 0.5,
  "hmin": 0.3,
  "vmax": 0.5,
  "vmin": 0.3
},
{
  "hmax": 1.0,
  "hmin": 0.7,
  "vmax": 1,
  "vmin": 0.7
}
```

### Additional properties
You may connected different LED stripes with different RGB byte orders. You can overwrite the global RGB byte order by adding a `colorOrder` property to all LEDs that require a different one.
``` json
{
  "hmax": 0.2,
  "hmin": 0,
  "vmax": 0.2,
  "vmin": 0,
  "colorOrder":"gbr"
},
{
  "hmax": 0.5,
  "hmin": 0.3,
  "vmax": 0.5,
  "vmin": 0.3
},
{
  "hmax": 1.0,
  "hmin": 0.7,
  "vmax": 1,
  "vmin": 0.7
}
```
In this example the first LED will be `gbr`, the other LEDs will be assigned to the global RGB order that has been defined at the led hardware section.

### Edit with Web Configuration
While editing these values in a local text editor is a little bit weird, you could edit them at the web configuration!
  - Make sure you raised the [Hyperion Settings level](../Configuration.md#settings-level) to **Advanced**.
  - Navigate to Configuration -> LED Hardware and switch to the LED Layout tab. You will notice a new section **Generated/Current LED Configuration**.

You could freely edit the values, show a preview on the right side by clicking **Update Preview**. When you are happy with the changes don't forget to save.

## Blackbar detection
Explain the differences between the available modes for blackbar detection.

  * **Default:** 3 scan-lines in each direction (X Y) - fastest detection
  * **Classic:** The original implementation - lower CPU time (legacy for RPi 1) just scan the top one third of the picture which leads to a  slow detection and trouble with TV channel logo.
  * **OSD:** Based on the default mode - not that effective but prevents border switching which may caused of OSD overlays (program infos and volume bar).
  * **Letterbox:** Based on the default mode - only considers blackbars at the top and bottom of the picture, ignoring the sides.

## Gamma Curve
Gamma values in a graphic. AS you see 1.0 is neutral. Lower than 1.0 increase the colour, higher reduce colour.

## Event Services 

With Hperion's event services capabilities you can link Operating system, time-based and/or CEC events to actions executed.

### Operating System Events

Settings related to different Operating System events Hyperion can handle.

* **Listen to suspend events**: Enable/Disable listing to operating system suspend/resume events
* **Listen to lock events**: Enable/Disable listing to screen lock/unlock events
* **Suspend when locked**: Suspend when the screen is locked, otherwise go into idle mode

### Scheduled Events

Settings related to scheduled, i.e. time based events, which Hyperion will handle.

You can define multiple event/action sets to configure which action should take place on a point in time. The action will be scheduled daily.
* **Time**: Point in time that will trigger an action
* **Action**: Action to be applied

### CEC Events

Settings related to different CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) protocol events Hyperion can handle-

You can define multiple event/action sets to configure which action should take place on a recognised CEC event
* **Action**: Action to be applied
* **CEC Event**: CEC event that will trigger an action
